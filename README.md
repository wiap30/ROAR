[4:46 PM] Amberlee AllmondAssignment 3: Twitter Clone HTML & CSS
!! Thumbs Up after reading all requirements !!

GitHub Classrooms Assignment
Assigned: Wednesday, 5 April 2023
Due: Monday, 10 April 2023 EOD (5p EDT)

The next phase of building your twitter clone now that you have your mockups complete is to build this using HTML & CSS. We will later take this version and tie in a RESTful web service to inject content and add button functionality, but right now, focus on hardcoding this and properly taking your design and translating it to code.

Acceptance Criteria( These are all the must haves.No exceptions!!):

Use Flexbox or Grid system layout for the basic structure of your elements
Hardcode the text and don't worry about getting information from somewhere else
Be able to navigate to the different pages. For example, clicking on "Login" should bring me to the login page, filling out the information and clicking "login" should then lead me to the dashboard page. Then, clicking "logout" should bring me back to the login page.
Separate your css files by pages. Do NOT have one giant CSS file
If you want to make something different from your mockup, that's fine, just don't change too much without keeping track of your changes and modifying the mockup if need be.

Optional:

You CAN use reusable components from Bootstrap

GitHub Requirements:

At least 10 commits pushed to GitHub

Sample Repo Structure:

assets/
main.html
main.css
login.html
login.css

asset/ -- this is a folder
